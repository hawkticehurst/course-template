      <h2>What is a Mentor Circle?</h2>
      <p>
        In Spring 2019, we introduced "Mentor Circles" for the first time. The Allen School has kindly
        allowed us to hire 3-4 part time TAs, each whom will conduct one hour long mentor circles
        each week where they will meet in small groups of about 5-6 students.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students in these groups, with the assistance of their "Mentor TA," will work
        to complete any of the section material that wasn't finished in class,
        go over questions from previous sections or lectures, and perhaps help
        brainstorm ideas for creative projects. The mentor circles will
        <strong>NOT</strong> be a place to get help with homework assignments, however.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately the goal of the Mentor Circle is to build a place where
        students can solidify knowledge and confidence in the course material so they will be
        able to more easily complete the homework assignments on their own. Furthermore,
        it is a place for students to form a small cohort and community with others in the
        course.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="mentor-circle-who" class="text-focus-in main-content">
      <h2>Who is a Mentor Circle for?</h2>
      <p>
        Mentor Circles are open to all, but preference will be given to students who
        have less prior programming experience and who are willing to commit to
        at least 6 weeks of our meeting times.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mentor-circle-when" class="text-focus-in main-content">
      <h2>What times are the circles and who are running them?</h2>
      <p>
        Mentorship assignments will be finalized at the end of the first week depending on survey responses.
      </p>

    <section id="mentor-circle-signup" class="text-focus-in main-content">
      <h2>How do I sign up?</h2>
      <p>
        Fill out this <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="">form</a>
        by *Insert Date*.

    <section id="mentor-circle-goal" class="text-focus-in main-content">
      <h2>When will they start?</h2>
      <p>
        The goal is to start this as soon as possible so students can begin to form their
        cohort that will last through the quarter. We also want to be able to support
        students as we are ramping up on HTML/CSS and Git.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to start the circles on Week 1, even though the window
        to sign up will not yet be closed. We would like to make sure students have an opportunity
        to do extra work on our Week 1 section material or their creative project before it
        is due.

    <section id="mentor-circle-citation" class="text-focus-in main-content">
      <h2>Where did this awesome idea come from?</h2>
      <p>
        Giving credit where credit is due: This idea was born out of a conversation
        with <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="https://kevinl.info/">Kevin Lin</a>
        from UC Berekely regarding his very successful work with mentoring groups there.
