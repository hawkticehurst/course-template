      <h1 class="page-title slide-right-focus-in">Exploration Sessions</h1>
      <p class="text-focus-in">Our goal is to offer CSE 154 exploration sessions, much like those that were offered in
        CSE 142 & 143. This is to give you an opportunity to explore a different topic primarily in web technologies,
        client/server programming, and more. We will try to offer these once a week. The sessions will also be recorded.
      </p>
      <p class="text-focus-in">Please come prepared to listen and ask questions of the guest speaker. You may be asked
        to work on a laptop during the session, but you can also be paired with a classmate if you do not have a laptop
        to bring with you. If we find that you are using your laptop or other device for something that is not session
        related, we will ask you to put it away or leave, and you will not receive credit (your "exploration point") for
        attending.</p>

      <h2 class="text-focus-in">Earning Exploration Points</h2>
      <p class="text-focus-in">Students who attend these sessions and participate will earn one "exploration point"
        which will be added to your homework grade.</p>

      <h2 class="text-focus-in">Conflicts</h2>
      <p class="text-focus-in">You must be present to earn your exploration point. However, we acknowledge that many of
        you may have legitimate school or familial conflicts that will prevent you from attending in person. These could
        include:</p>
      <ul class="text-focus-in">
        <li>You're registered for another class</li>
        <li>An exam that is timed concurrently to a session</li>
        <li>Other standing school obligations such as Husky Band rehearsal (please check with the instructors)</li>
        <li>Familial obligations such as picking up family members from school/daycare that no one else can cover</li>
        <li>Religious obligations</li>
        <li>Other conflicts AS APPROVED BY THE INSTRUCTOR(S) prior to the event</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-focus-in">If you have such a conflict but would still like to particpate in an exploration session,
        you may provided you follow these steps:</p>
      <ol class="text-focus-in">
        <li>
          Fill out this
          <a class="blue-link" target="_blank" href="#">form</a>
          <b>PRIOR</b> to the session requesting the make up.</li>
        <li>Watch the Panopto video once it has been posted below within one week of recording.</li>
        <li>Email the course instructor for the password to the Canvas quiz associated with the session.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate your understanding of the material through the associated Canvas quiz.</li>
      </ol>
